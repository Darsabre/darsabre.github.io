THINGS I NEED

TURN TRACKING:  bar that says player 1 to move or player 2 to move.

1) make each button work.
  1a before button adds whatever is in the entry field to the front of the word.
  1b after button adds whatever is in the entry field to the back of the word
2) check word.
  gets the current word after every play and checks if that word is in the dictionary. if it is,
  the player who played the last letter loses, otherwise next player's turn.
3) CHALLENGE
    gets a prompt from the person who played the last letter (the challenged player)
    and check if the prompt contains the word. if it doesn't the challenger wins.
    if the prompt does contain the word, check it against the dictionary.  if it is present, the
    challenged player wins, otherwise, the challenger wins.

THINGS IT WOULD BE COOL TO HAVE
AI.  for every element in dictionary, challenge.  remove ones that fail.
do mod2 for (total wordlength -playernumber of ai) if answer is 1, reject word.
pick a random word remaining, play a viable letter in that word.
